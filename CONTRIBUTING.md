# Contributing to MusicBox Interactive

We would prefer all collaborations to begin with a conversation. MusicBox Interactive aims to suppor the community of atmospheric science through interactive box modelling, both for fundamental science and educational settings.

# Bug Reports

Please report any bugs at (music-box-interactive-client/issues)[https://github.com/NCAR/music-box-interactive-client/issues/new?template=bug_report.md]. Our issue templates our exhaustive and should help to provide the development team
with enough context to understand and recreate the bug.

# New Features

We are happy to accept feature enchancements, however MusicBox Interactive has three key components:

1. This project, the user-facing UI ,
2. A server API, this provides the interface to start model simulations, upload/download configuration files, and retrieve results
3. And finally, [MusicBox](https://github.com/NCAR/music-box), which runs the actual model. 

Each project can evolve independently of the other, but in some cases may require new functionality in more than one project. A conversation about what is desired will help the development team create the appropriate design and ease implementation.
