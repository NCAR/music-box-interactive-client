          Simulate chamber or flow-tube experiments, recreate field
          observations, or evalute the effects of new chemistry on an existing
          system. MusicBox is designed to let you build the chemical system you
          want. You can simulate that system for the conditions you're
          interested in, and evalute the results.

          When you're ready, communicate your new chemical system to the
